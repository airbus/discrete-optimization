# External solvers hub.
This module is aimed to store some wrapper to solver with low integration level with the lib,
but that are relevant to some of our problem.
As this is not a mandatory library that comes from the lib, we build it outside the classical way (with cp_tools, lp_tools, and so on).


## Exhaustive list of external solvers partially wrapped to discrete-opt, and associated problems:

| Solver                                                        | Description                              | Problems                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| [Tempo](https://gepgitlab.laas.fr/roc/emmanuel-hebrard/tempo) | Disjunctive scheduling solver            | Workforce scheduling problem |
| KAMIS                                                         | Local search methods for independent set | Maximum independent set      |
| LKH (planned)                                                 | Heuristic for TSP and variants           | TSP/VRP                      |
| OptalCP | Scheduling CP Solver | Scheduling |
|
For Tempo and OptalCP, as we will use it in several problem, we create some common API in this module.
Models of OptalCP are adapted from the OptalCp-Benchmarks repository for which we got agreement on their usage for the library. Free version allows to retrieve best objective solution and bound through time (allowing Studies in our d-o library), whereas a full licence allows to retrieve the solution.
