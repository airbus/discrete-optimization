# Getting started

To get started with the library,
one can refer to the [tutorials](./notebooks) under the "notebooks" section.
They mainly focus on using pre-implemented problems and dedicated solvers, and a bit more in the "Advanced" section.


If you want to implement your own problem class or solver class, read this [guide](howto_new_problem_implementation/tutorial_new_problem_or_solver.md).


You can also have a look to the [dashboard](dashboard.md) section to see how
to get graphs summarizing experiments on a bunch of solvers and problems.
