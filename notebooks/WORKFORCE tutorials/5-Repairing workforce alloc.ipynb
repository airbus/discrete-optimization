    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we used Minimal Unsatisfiable Subset (MUS) analysis to identify **why** a disrupted workforce allocation problem became infeasible. Now, we'll shift our focus to **how to fix it**. The goal is not just to find a solution, but to make the smallest possible change to the original plan to restore feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll introduce the concept of a **Minimal Correction Subset (MCS)**, a minimal set of constraints that, when relaxed or removed, makes the problem solvable again. You'll learn how to leverage MCS to build an **interactive tool** that guides the user to a feasible, \"repaired\" schedule by highlighting the minimum necessary changes, enabling them to make informed decisions about which tasks to drop."

    "2. **Solve it to Optimality** using Constraint Programming.\n",
    "3. **Model Disruptions** that can make a plan infeasible.\n",

    "5. **Repair and Resolve infeasibility** by finding and relaxing the Minimal Correction Subset (MCS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up: We will explore an even more advanced approach. Instead of simply dropping tasks, we'll learn how to repair a disrupted schedule through intelligent rescheduling. This involves solving a multi-objective problem to find a new, feasible solution that remains as close as possible to the original plan."
