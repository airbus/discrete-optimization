    "# 6. Intelligent Rescheduling for Disruption Repair\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we explored how to handle unsatisfiable (UNSAT) problems by identifying the core conflict (MUS) and interactively relaxing constraints, which often meant dropping a task from the schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "While effective, dropping tasks is often a last resort. A more flexible approach is **rescheduling**: can we find a feasible solution by not only re-allocating tasks to different teams but also by **shifting their start times**?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces feasibility restoration through rescheduling. We will model this as a multi-objective optimization problem where the goal is to find a new, valid schedule that is as close as possible to our original plan. We will use **Lexicographical Optimization** to explore different repair strategies by prioritizing different \"similarity\" objectives."

    "By looking at the results, you can clearly see the trade-off. **Strategy A** resulted in fewer team reallocations but had to shift more tasks (and by a larger amount). **Strategy B** kept the schedule very stable in time (`nb_shift` is low) but at the cost of reassigning many more tasks to different teams.\n",

    "This notebook has shown how to move beyond simple feasibility checking. By combining rescheduling with a multi-objective lexicographical approach, we can provide planners with a set of intelligent, alternative repair strategies. This empowers them to make informed decisions that balance competing operational priorities when faced with inevitable, real-world disruptions.\n",
