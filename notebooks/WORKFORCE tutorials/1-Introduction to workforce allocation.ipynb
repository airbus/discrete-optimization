    "\n",
    "Welcome to this series on the **Workforce Allocation Problem (WAP)**. In this first notebook, we will introduce the problem's core concepts, constraints, and objectives. We'll explore a sample problem instance and build a simple, heuristic-based solution to understand the fundamentals before diving into more advanced optimization techniques in the upcoming notebooks."

    "## What is the Workforce Allocation Problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Workforce Allocation Problem is a type of assignment and scheduling problem where you need to assign a set of resources (teams) to a set of jobs (tasks) while respecting a variety of constraints. It's a common challenge in workforce management, project planning, and logistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Entities:**\n",
    "* A set of $N$ **tasks** or **activities**, each with a predefined start time $s_i$ and end time $e_i$.\n",
    "* A set of $M$ **teams** or **resources**, each with its own work calendar defining their windows of availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Constraints:**\n",
    "* **Unique Assignment:** Each task must be assigned to exactly one team.\n",
    "* **Conflict Constraint:** If two tasks $i$ and $k$ overlap in time (i.e., their time intervals $[s_i, e_i)$ and $[s_k, e_k)$ intersect), they cannot be assigned to the same team.\n",
    "* **Availability Constraint:** A team can only be assigned to a task if it is available for the *entire duration* of that task.\n",
    "* **Compatibility Constraint:** Some tasks may have a restricted list of teams that are qualified to perform them (e.g., due to skill requirements).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "* The primary objective is typically to find a valid assignment of teams to all tasks that **minimizes the total number of unique teams used**."
