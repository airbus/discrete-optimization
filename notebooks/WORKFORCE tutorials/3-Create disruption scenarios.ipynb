    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we found an optimal solution to the Workforce Allocation Problem. However, real-world operations are rarely static. Disruptions—such as a team becoming unavailable can make your current plan/allocation obsolete and even infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on modeling such disruptions. We will use a scenario generator to create modified problem instances from our original plan. We will see how some disruptions can be accommodated, while others can make the problem **unsatisfiable (UNSAT)**, meaning no solution exists that respects all the rules."
